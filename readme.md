Precise Date & Time Picker as dialog box with am pm military time options and calendar view.

Hi humans. I looked for a date time picker but I did not like it. Properties:
1- It has a failsafe system that prevents you to enter unwanted characters
2- You can choose am, pm and 24 hour options
3- It opens as dialog box so your app structure would not be affected
4- You will be able to see which week and day that your option belongs to.
5- It returns the outcome in detail as dictionary so you can use values as you wish,
6- You can modify month day and other inputs according to the languages that you want
7- If you forget to pick any option it will show an error message before exiting.
8- The width is compatible with the smallest smartphone screen width which is 320 px.
9- When the screen is modified, in other words orientation is changed, the widgets move accordingly. 

All you need to do is to copy the content of the date_time_clock.py file and paste it to your codes. Than import it in your related .py file as it is instructed in the file. 
Then give reference to the function and enjoy.
